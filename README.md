# Excel_8Queens

No fancy backtracking, no complex algorhtms, just pure, elementary math to solve a problem that is used as a popular case for the first two.

Problem Description:
  The 8-queens problem consists of a case in which 8-queens should be placed on a standard chessboard (8X8) in such a manner that none of the queens can capture each other. This is a popular problem used to test skills and proficiency in backtracking and data structures.

What if, it could be solved in a fraction of the time, with just the right constraints, using a basic Simplex Linear Programming algorithm? 

Elementary, my dear Watson!
